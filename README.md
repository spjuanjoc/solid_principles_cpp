SOLID principles in C++

## SRP: Single Responsibility Principle

## OCP: Open-Closed Principle

DB Filter specific search

## LSP: Liskov Substitution Principle

A square is not a rectangle. 
Use a Factory to create each.

## ISP: Interface Segregation Principle

Multifunction printer: Create an interface for each component

## DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Example:  
Report logger: Depend on interfaces.
